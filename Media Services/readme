## Instructions for Setting Up Drives and Mounting in Debian

### Checking UUID of Drive

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the following command to list all drives and their UUIDs:
   ```sh
   sudo blkid
   ```
3. Note the UUID of the drive you want to mount.

### Mounting Drive in `fstab`

1. Open the `fstab` file in a text editor:
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```
2. Add the following line to the file, replacing `<UUID>` with the UUID of your drive and `<mount_point>` with the desired mount point:
   ```plaintext
   UUID=<UUID>  <mount_point>  ext4  defaults  0  2
   ```
3. Save and close the file.
4. Create the mount point directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p <mount_point>
   ```
5. Mount all filesystems:
   ```sh
   sudo mount -a
   ```

## Instructions for Setting Up Drives and Mounting in Debian

### Checking UUID of Drive

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the following command to list all drives and their UUIDs:
   ```sh
   sudo blkid
   ```
3. Note the UUID of the drive you want to mount.

### Mounting Drive in `fstab`

1. Open the `fstab` file in a text editor:
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```
2. Add the following line to the file, replacing `<UUID>` with the UUID of your drive and `<mount_point>` with the desired mount point:
   ```plaintext
   UUID=<UUID>  <mount_point>  ext4  defaults  0  2
   ```
3. Save and close the file.
4. Create the mount point directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p <mount_point>
   ```
5. Mount all filesystems:
   ```sh
   sudo mount -a
   ```

### Pre-making Referenced Files and Directories

Ensure all referenced files and directories in the Docker-compose file are created:

1. Create directories for Sonarr:
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/seagate/Shows
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/seagate/Completed\ Torrents
   ```

2. Create directories for Radarr:
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/seagate/Movies
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/seagate/Completed\ Torrents
   ```

3. Create directories for qBittorrent:
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/seagate/Completed\ Torrents
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/seagate/Unfinished\ Torrents
   ```

4. Create directories for Plex:
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/seagate
   sudo mkdir -p ./Test
   ```

5. Create directories for WordPress:
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p ./wordpress
   ```

6. Create directories for Overseerr:
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p ../.cnf
   ```

Ensure the directories have the correct permissions:
```sh
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /mnt/seagate
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./Test
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./wordpress
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ../.cnf
```

### Downloading Required Software

Before deploying the Docker stack, ensure you have the following software installed:

1. **Docker**: Follow the instructions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker on your system.
2. **Docker Compose**: Follow the instructions on the [Docker Compose website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to install Docker Compose.

Verify the installations by running:
```sh
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

Once the software is installed, you can deploy the Docker stack using:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
